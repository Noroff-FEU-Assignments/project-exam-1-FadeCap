FadeDisc - A disc golf blog 

Live website: [Hosted on Netlify](https://project-exam-semester-1-stian.netlify.app/)

## Description

For this project I was tasked with creating a website for blogs. I chose to go with a disc golf blog.
In this project I used wordpress REST API to fetch and display the blog posts I had created on my headless wordpress website. 

- Create a Home page, About page, List of blogs, Blog post specific page and a Contact page
- Carousel for homepage, with blogs fetched from the REST API
- Contact page:
    Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
    Email address (Must be a valid email address)
    Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
    Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)
- Use Javascript for validation on the contact page. Show error mesages if the requirements are not met. 
- Use Javascript to fetch and display a list of blog posts, and a specific blog posts page
